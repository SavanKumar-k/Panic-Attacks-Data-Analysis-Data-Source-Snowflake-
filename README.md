# Panic Attack Data Analysis (Snowflake + Power BI Interactive Dashboard)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes panic attack patterns and symptoms to uncover health risk factors, lifestyle influences, and trends across patients. Patient-level data was connected from **Snowflake** into **Power BI** as the data source for dashboard creation. The dashboards visualize symptoms, sleep patterns, lifestyle habits, and panic attack severity, enabling data-driven insights for better understanding of mental health.

## Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/SavanKumar-k/Loan-Default-Data-Analysis/blob/main/loan_approval_dataset.csv">Dataset</a>
  # Patient-level data on panic attacks, including:
- Symptoms (dizziness, trembling, chest pain, sweating, shortness of breath)
- Lifestyle factors (sleep hours, drinks per week)
- Panic attack duration (minutes)
- Panic score & severity levels

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Snowflake** – Data source (connected to Power BI)  
- **Power BI** – Dashboard & visualization  
- **Excel** – Data preprocessing & validation  

---

## Process
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation** – Performed in Excel (handling duplicates, standardizing values, validating numeric fields)  
- **Data Source Integration** – Connected Snowflake tables into Power BI for live querying  
- **Visualization** – Designed interactive Power BI dashboards with slicers, drilldowns, and KPIs  
- **Insights** – Identified symptom trends, lifestyle impacts, and severity correlations

## Key Questions Answered
- How many patients reported dizziness, trembling, chest pain, sweating, or shortness of breath?  
- What is the distribution of patients by sleep hours?  
- What is the distribution of panic attack duration (minutes)?  
- How many patients consume drinks per week, and how does it affect panic attacks?  
- What are the averages of **sleep hours, panic attacks per patient, and panic score**?

## Project Insights
- Shorter sleep hours were associated with higher panic scores.  
- Dizziness, trembling, and chest pain were the most reported symptoms.  
- Patients with frequent panic attacks tended to have longer panic attack durations.  
- Alcohol consumption showed a correlation with higher panic attack severity.  
- Sleep hours and lifestyle factors provide useful predictors of panic risk.

## Conclusion
This project highlights how **Snowflake (as a data source) + Power BI dashboards** can provide actionable insights into mental health by analyzing symptoms, lifestyle, and severity of panic attacks. Such insights can support healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients and designing targeted interventions.
